Description: A comprehensive tool for bulk RNA-seq analysis that facilitates 
    gene mapping from Ensembl to R Studio. The package provides functions for 
    differential expression analysis using DESeq2, local gene annotation 
    mapping, and visualization tools. Features include data preprocessing,
    statistical analysis, and generation of publication-ready visualizations.
